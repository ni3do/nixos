# Personal nixOS configs

This repo is for my personal NixOS machines and Nix Package Manager

The following machines are being configured:

1. _madara_: MacOS (Darwin, arm) machine powered by NixOS package manager for environment and user configuration
2. _jarvis_: Homelab (x64) powered by NixOS
3. _raspi_: RasperryPI (arm)
